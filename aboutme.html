        <h1 class='introduction'>About Me</h1>

        <p>My family and I live in Connecticut.  We moved here last year from California.  There are two cute guys in my family: my son, Dmitrii and my husband, Sergei.  Dmitrii is turning 11 this month and will be going to 6th grade next year.  He loves Lego, swimming and videogames.  My husband Sergei is a tech lead in a financial company.  He loves chess, biking and swimming as well.</p> 
        
        <p> We have a cute tabby cat named Yoga.  We got her more than 5 years ago in New York City at a shelter in Harlem.  She's been traveling with us to California, then to Connecticut and seems to be enjoying her life in the woods.  She loves to chase mice and squirrels around the yard. </p>
